    "description": "This workflow is a sample of how you can leverage AWS Step Functions for performing typical video edition. Specifically, this example uses a video that has a SMPTE color bars of random duration and the beginning. The workflow will get a demo video from S3, puts it through Amazon Rekognition for detecting segments, and then Amazon MediaConvert removes the initial video segment (SMPTE color bars). ",

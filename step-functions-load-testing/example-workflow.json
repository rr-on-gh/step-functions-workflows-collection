        "When the step function is triggered it first starts the ramp-up phase. In this phase it starts a timer to monitor if the ramp up time is reached. It then uses a distributed map to calls the Lambda function in parallel. After each execution of the distributed map ends, the Step Function checks if the ramp up time is reached and increases the concurrency of the distributed map. Once the ramp up time is reached, the state machine then send the load to the Lambda for the time specified in input."
